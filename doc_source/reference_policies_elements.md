# IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference<a name="reference_policies_elements"></a>

An JSON policy in IAM is made up of elements\. The elements are listed here in the general order you use them in a policy\. The order of the elements doesn't matterâ€”for example, the `Resource` element can come before the `Action` element\. You're not required to specify any `Condition` elements in the policy\. 



**Note**  
The details of what goes into a policy vary for each service, depending on what actions the service makes available, what types of resources it contains, and so on\. When you're writing policies for a specific service, it's helpful to see examples of policies for that service\. For a list of all the services that support IAM, and for links to the documentation in those services that discusses IAM and policies, see [AWS Services That Work with IAM](reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.md)\.
